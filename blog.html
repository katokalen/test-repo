        <p>This is me writing a blog post about how much I love web pages. Web pages are pretty cool, and getting to build them is even better. It's like when Toto pulls open the curtain in the Wizard of Oz, and you find out that the scary wizard is really just a dumpy old man with levers and switches.</p>
        <p>I also really like being able to work with the appearance and interactions on webpages. I think there is a great deal for people to learn from understanding how and why we click, scroll, hover, and use the mouse the way we do.</p>
        <p>Last, but not least, it's a great skill to have, because it helps you to understand how content on the internet is created and served. So much of our lives is content that is generated and served up over the internet, and having some insight into how that content is transmitted and interpreted is very powerful.</p>
